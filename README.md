# google-cloud-print

This is a tiny, bare minimal Google Cloud Print PHP client that can discover a printer,
print a PDF, accept an invitation to a shared printer, and that's about it. It uses
a Service Account for authentication. 

It's got no error handling and is only here because I needed one for a tiny project
of mine to print my morning crossword out. However, given the paucity of information 
on using Google Cloud Print, especially with a service account, I figured I might
make it public in case it helped anyone else along the way.
